# Cryptocurrency Clustering Using K-Means and PCA

This repository demonstrates a data science project focused on clustering cryptocurrencies based on their market data. The project uses **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and **K-Means clustering** for grouping cryptocurrencies into meaningful clusters. The analysis explores the impact of scaling data and reducing features on clustering performance.

## Overview

This project analyzes cryptocurrency market data to:
1. Group cryptocurrencies into clusters based on their features.
2. Compare clustering performance before and after feature scaling and dimensionality reduction.
3. Visualize and interpret the resulting clusters.

The analysis demonstrates the effects of feature scaling and PCA on clustering performance and explores how reducing dimensionality impacts the interpretability and computational efficiency of clustering.
